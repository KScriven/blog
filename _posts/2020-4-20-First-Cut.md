Ok so here goes.  I've decided to start blogging and to be honest I have very mixed
feelings putting these thoughts of mine to virtual paper.  Its nerve wracking, I dont have have the confidence to *just blog* 

Whilst I had made the decision to blog or at least capture my learnings, I started to wonder about 
what platform service to use, which cloud stack best fits my need.. or do I go back to plain html and markdown and just get something up and running?  All this got me wasting precious time typing and learning.  I got stuck on some infrastructure stuff, spent time trying to what feels like fit a square into a round hole so here it is... a decision to go back to basics and use [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) alongside [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  Although I must admit I found a helpful github repo which I forked and got up and running with an hour.  

So to keep this sort and sweet, what crucially have I learnt today whilst setting up my blogging space.

1.  Dont get too hung up over the technology stack.  Start with something that gets to you going
2.  Its true when they say starting is the **hardest** part, I can procrastinate on minor details!
3.  Im not looking to build award winning content, just something for me.  This is an extension to what will not fit in my brain these days
4.  You dont always have to stick to just one topic.  I was freating over should this be a tech blog, lifestyle blog, notes or just ramblings ... why not have it all?  Yes focus is important but it can encompass more than one thing!
5.  Things will change and iterate, its the nature of what we do!

I think I am goign to sign off there and just keep these thoughts short and to the point.
